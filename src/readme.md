# The Tour of Heroes application

The Tour of Heroes application that you build helps a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes. The application has many of the features you'd expect to find in any data-driven application. The finished application acquires and displays a list of heroes, edits a selected hero's detail, and navigates among different views of heroic data.

***Example application that exercises core Angular functionality:**

Use built-in Angular directives to show and hide elements and display lists of hero data
Create Angular components to display hero details and show an array of heroes
Use one-way data binding for read-only data
Add editable fields to update a model with two-way data binding
Bind component methods to user events, like keystrokes and clicks
Enable users to select a hero from a master list and edit that hero in the details view
Format data with pipes
Create a shared service to assemble the heroes
Use routing to navigate among different views and their components
